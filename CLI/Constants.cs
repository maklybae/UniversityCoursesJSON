Nota Bene: The program supports only formatted file as in the sample *.JSON file.
The program is controlled using the up/down arrows and enter button (left/right arrows are also useful for switching between pages in table-view)

Firstly, you need to enter JSON data from console or with file manager (which shows system drives, folders in current folder and *.JSON files).
Then, you will be able to:
- print data in table-view
- sort data by several fields at the same time
- select data by different parameters on different fields
- choose new file to process";
